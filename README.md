Ludum Dare 26 Project Skeleton & Warmup
=======================================
Game title: 1951
Description: It's a rather simple arcade/puzzle style game, where you need to use your mouse/touchscreen to merge particles that are floating on the screen, making sure to do so in the most efficient way in order not to blow up the reactor you're currently in, or something.

Whenever you merge two particles, the difference is added to the general instability. When that goes over the limit, you lose and have to restart the level. The key is to merge the particles in such a way that the differences remain as small as possible.

Dependencies:
-------------
It's a basic libgdx app. It uses the standard library structure. For non-computer people: don't worry, I'll publish a double-click-and-go version of my LD game when it's done! :D

Wish me luck!
