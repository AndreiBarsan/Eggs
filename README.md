Ludum Dare 26 Project Skeleton & Warmup
=======================================
Currently just rendering a bunch of blobs bouncing around. Press Space to blow them up, one at a time!

Dependencies:
-------------
It's a basic libgdx app. It uses the standard library structure. For non-computer people: don't worry, I'll publish a double-click-and-go version of my LD game when it's done! :D

Ludum Dare 26: 27-28 April, 2013

Wish me luck!
